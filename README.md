# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Project Overview

This project is a modern implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a visually appealing design with video backgrounds and smooth fade-in and fade-out transitions between pages, creating an engaging user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For structuring the game layout and elements.
- **CSS3:** For styling the game, including custom fonts, colors, and responsive design. CSS animations provide smooth transitions.
- **JavaScript:** For the game logic, handling player moves, determining the game outcome, and controlling the page transitions.

## Features

1. **Video Backgrounds:** Adds a dynamic and modern look.
2. **Smooth Transitions:** Fade-in and fade-out animations for seamless page transitions.
3. **Responsive Design:** Adaptable layout for desktop and mobile devices.
4. **Interactive Gameplay:** Alternating turns for "X" and "O", checks for win conditions, and declares a winner or draw.
5. **Reset and New Game Options:** Easily reset or start a new game.
6. **Customizable UI:** Styled UI elements for enhanced aesthetic appeal.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game:** From the main menu (`index.html`), click the "Start Game" button to navigate to the game page (`game.html`).
2. **Make a Move:** Click on any of the nine boxes in the game grid to place your mark ("X" or "O"). Players take turns to make their moves.
3. **Check for Winner:** The game will automatically check for a winner after each move. If a player wins, a congratulatory message is displayed. If all boxes are filled without a winner, the game declares a draw.
4. **Reset or New Game:** Use the "Reset Game" button to clear the current game and start over. Use the "New Game" button to begin a fresh game.

## Project Files

- **index.html:** The main menu of the game with a background video, title, game image, and "Start Game" button.
- **game.html:** The game interface where players can play Tic-Tac-Toe, with background video and "Reset Game" and "Back" buttons.
- **styles.css:** The stylesheet containing styles for both the main menu and game page, including the video background, buttons, and grid layout.
- **game.js:** The JavaScript file handling the game logic, including player turns, win conditions, and page transitions.
